# Predictive Finance using Neural Networks

This project implements an LSTM that predicts closing values, two days ahead, of six index funds:

    VIPIX: Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund Institutional Shares
    VINIX: Vanguard Institutional Index Fund Institutional Shares
    VIEIX: Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund Institutional Shares
    VTSNX: Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Institutional Shares
    VBTIX: Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Institutional Shares
    VBIRX: Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index Fund Admiral Shares

Several features are collected from YahooFinance and FRED websites regarding economic factors, and a feature selection technique is applied to identify the features not relevant to the expected outputs. For more information, please contact me.
